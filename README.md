This is it. mane.

DO NOT CLONE THIS REPO. YOU WILL BE DOING ALL WORK WITHIN YOUR FORKS.

We use git pull requests to merge code into the main codebase. Your code is reviewed by me. (don't worry I'm nice :)) and then approved, after which I'll merge it.

1. Create a fork of this repo.
2. Do all your work on a seperate branch from master.
3. When you're ready push the branch you did work on to github and then create a pull request to the main repo.
4. I'll check and confirm it's all good, then merge.
